Resources:
	During World War II, production peaked again, exceeding 1,000,000 metric tons (1,100 tons) for the first time in 1941
	Aluminum Production: 3,090,000 tons in 1954
	
	Meanwhile, aluminium gained uses elsewhere. Aluminium began to be used for the mass production of houseware that quickly and almost completely replaced copper and cast iron utensils. Aluminium frying pans and saucepans are light, warm and cool quickly and do not rust.
	Robert Victor Neher invented the method used for continuous aluminium rolling foil production in Switzerland in 1907. He launched the world's first foil rolling mill in 1910.
	Another critical moment for the aluminium industry began in 1920, when a group of scientists under the leadership of Soderberg from Norway invented a new aluminium production process that made the Hall- HÃ©roult method much cheaper. Previously, pre-baked coal blocks were used as anode cells during reduction; they were consumed quickly and so the use of new ones was required constantly. Soderberg solved this problem with the help of a continuous electrode. It is formed in a special reduction chamber from a coke and tar paste and added to the upper hole of the electrolyte cell when required.
	The aluminium can, an iconic product that became one of the largest aluminium commodities, the symbol of environmental friendliness and a focal point in the field of art and design, emerged in the USA in 1958.
