  USA_character_coolidge_desc: "Calvin Coolidge is the Republican politician serving as the 30th President of the United States of America. A professional lawyer, he had entered politics as a city councilman in Northampton, Massachusetts. Over the years, he rose through the ranks in Massachusetts state politics, proceeding to serve as a senator and lieutenant governor before eventually becoming governor of Massachusetts. In this position, he attracted national attention with the manner in which he managed a crisis involving Boston policemen who went on strike. He took decisive action at the time, calling out the state guard to quell the violence that had erupted as a result of the Boston Police Strike. His calm demeanor and the ability to take strong action in a timely manner earned him the respect of Republicans throughout the nation. The Republicans chose Coolidge as the vice presidential candidate to run along with the presidential candidate Warren Harding in 1920. The duo won, and Coolidge assumed his duties as vice president in March 1921. President Harding died suddenly in 1923, and Calvin Coolidge assumed the presidency amid the chaos that followed Harding's death. Despite taking over the presidency during a period of turmoil, Coolidge has proved to be an efficient president and had easily elected President in his own right in 1924."

  GER_paul_hindenburg_desc: "Coming from an aristocratic Prussian family, Paul von Hindenburg joined the Prussian army as a young man, retiring as a general in 1913 at age 66. Recalled to duty during World War I, he was placed in command of the German forces at the battle of Tannenberg in 1914 against the Russians which, due to a combination of his skillful tactics and staggeringly incompetent leadership on the part of the Russian generals, resulted in a disastrous defeat for the Russian army, which lost an estimated 350,000 men. In 1916 he was made supreme commander of all German forces. He retired from the army again in 1919, but in 1925 returned to public life as a candidate for President of Germany, and won the election."
  FRA_character_raymond_desc: "The French statesman Raymond Poincaré served as president of France during World War I and four times as its premier. French politics from 1912 to 1929 have been largely dominated by the figures of Raymond Poincaré and Georges Clemenceau. As premier, and then president before World War I, Poincaré pursued a nationalistic policy that contributed to world tension. During World War I, he entrusted the premiership to Clemenceau. Returning to active politics in 1922, Poincaré, as premier, followed an intransigent policy toward Germany, occupying the Ruhr to ensure German payment of reparations, an action that contributed to the economic collapse in Germany. He also dealt effectively with the French financial crises in 1924 and 1926."
