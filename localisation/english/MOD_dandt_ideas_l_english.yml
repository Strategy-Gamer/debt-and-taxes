  laissez_faire: "Laissez-faire"
  laissez_faire_desc: "Laissez-faire, or 'let do' translated from French, is an economic system where actions between individuals and businesses are free from any government intervention. Its first use was in France where king Louis XV, in 1754, abolished all tolls and restraints on the sale of grain. Laissez-faire became an integral part of ninteenth-century European liberalism. Its popularity, since the 1800's, has wained."
  economic_intervention: "Economic Intervention"
  economic_intervention_desc: "Economic Intevention is similar to the Laissez-faire system, however it allows government stepping in from time to time. One example of government intervention is the Trans-Continental Railroad, funded by the United States government, built by private companies. It still allows companies extreme freedom to do what they like, though with the government peering at them over a wall."
  regulated_economy: "Regulated Economy"
  regulated_economy_desc: "A Regulated Economy is one where the government decides what companies can not do. In Debt and Taxes, it is much more interventionist than Economic Intervention, with plenty more options for you to intervene in economic affairs. An example of a regulated economy is of the USA today."
  partly_nationalized: "Partly-Nationalized"
  partly_nationalized_desc: "A Partly-Nationalized economy combines the regulation of a regulated economy and nationalization of certain key industries or businesses in the country. This could range from state-owned railway services, to entire industrial segments being owned by the government. An example of a Partly-Nationalized economy is of Nazi Germany in the 1930's and 1940's."
  state_capitalism: "State Capitalism"
  state_capitalism_desc: "State Capitalism is an economic system where the means of production are organized and managed a state-owned business enterprises. An example of State Capitalism would be the People's Republic of China today."
  planned_economy: "Planned Economy"
  planned_economy_desc: "A Planned Economy is one where investment and allocation of capital goods take place according to economic and production plans. Planned Economies are usually associated with Soviet-type central planning, however forms of planned economies go as far back to Ancient Egypt."
