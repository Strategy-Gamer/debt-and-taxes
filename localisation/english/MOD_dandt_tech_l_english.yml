  # Drilling
  TECH_DRILLING_TITLE: "DRILLING"
  tech_cable_tool_drilling: "Cable-Tool Drilling"
  tech_cable_tool_drilling_desc: "Cable-tool drilling is becoming a widely regarded method of drilling by which a hole is made through repeated blows generated by the rising and falling action of a heavy chisel bit on rocks or underground formations. Only a few feet can be drilled in a day as drilling must be halted so that the cuttings may be removed and formation fluid pressures can be managed. The heavy chisel bit is the "tool" part, and the cable is to be made of something as simple as a manila rope or a wireline."
  tech_early_rotary_drilling: "Early Rotary Drilling"
  tech_early_rotary_drilling_desc: "Rotary drilling uses a sharp, rotating drill bit to drill down through the Earth's crust. Much like a common hand-held drill, the spinning of the drill bit allows for penetration of even the hardest rock. The basic rotary drilling system consists of four groups of components—the prime movers, hoisting equipment, rotating equipment and circulating equipment—that all combine to make rotary drilling possible."
  tech_shaft_driven_rotary_table: "Shaft-Driven Rotary Table"

The newest design, a single unitized frame with a simplified drum, provides a significantly reduced moment of inertia."
  tech_directional_drilling: "Directional Drilling"
  tech_directional_drilling_desc: "Directional drilling is the practice of drilling non-vertical bores. It can be broken down into four main groups: oilfield directional drilling, utility installation directional drilling, directional boring, and surface in seam (SIS), which horizontally intersects a vertical bore target to extract coal bed methane. Directional drilling is significantly slower than vertical drilling due to the need to stop frequently and conduct time-consuming surveys, as well as slower drilling progress, though it proves its benefits through its efficiency."
  tech_drilling_mud: "Drilling Mud"
  tech_drilling_mud_desc: "Drilling mud is a heavy viscous fluid mixture that carries rock cuttings to the surface. Many muds are oil-based, using direct products of petroleum refining such as diesel oil or mineral oil as the fluid matrix. Drilling mud is pumped down the hollow drill pipe to the drill bit and then flushed back up the borehole. Water-and synthetic-based muds contain water, bentonite and barite for viscosity and weight, and various emulsifiers and lubricants."

  tech_standardized_derrick_desc: "A derrick is a lifting device composed at minimum of one guyed mast, as in a gin pole, which may be articulated over a load by adjusting its guys. Most derricks have at least two components, either a guyed mast or self-supporting tower, and a boom hinged at its base to provide articulation, as in a stiffleg derrick. The most basic type of derrick is controlled by three or four lines connected to the top of the mast, which allow it both to move laterally and cant up and down."
  tech_hydraulic_ram_type_blowout_preventer: "Hydraulic Ram-Type Blowout Preventer"
  tech_hydraulic_ram_type_blowout_preventer_desc: "A blowout preventer is a specialized valve or comparable mechanical device used to seal, manage, and monitor oil and gas wells to prevent blowouts, the uncontrolled discharge of crude oil or natural gas from a well. Blowout preventers with hydraulic actuators may offer a number of benefits: The opposing hydraulic cylinders' pressure might be balanced, which will cause the rams to move together. Hydraulic rams will also work effectively in high-pressure wells and enable relatively quick actuation and remote control."
  tech_tricone_bit: "Tricone Bit"
  tech_tricone_bit_desc: "Drilling for oil and gas is still very demanding in many areas around the world. Rotary drilling is the most common technique for drilling oil and gas, and since the invention of rotary drilling, roller-cone has been the most viable. Tricone bits have three rotating cones with each one rotating on its own axis during drilling. They are used in general to drill a wide variety of rocks, from soft to extremely hard, and since the wear of drill bits is considered an intrinsic cost, significant savings can be achieved by effective control and minimisation of bit wear."
  tech_on_water_drilling: "On-Water Drilling"
  tech_on_water_drilling_desc: "Planted into the ocean floor on a tower, an offshore oil rig operates dozens of offshore oil wells, producing both oil and gas.

The primary function of bucket-wheel excavator is to act as a continuous digging machine in large-scale open-pit mining operations, removing thousands of tons of overburden a day. They use a large wheel consisting of a continuous pattern of buckets used to scoop material as the wheel turns."
  tech_mine_mechanization: "Mine Mechanization"
  tech_mine_mechanization_desc: "Mechanization is the use of machines, either wholly or in part, to replace human or animal labor. Unlike automation, which may not depend at all on a human operator, mechanization requires human participation to provide information or instruction. Mining has been integrated into this system of mechanization, allowing specialized equipment to reduce the number of laborers while increasing efficiency through machinery."
  tech_continuous_mining: "Continuous Mining"
  tech_continuous_mining_desc: "The conventional mining techniques, made up of the cyclic operations of cutting, drilling, blasting, and loading, developed in association with room-and-pillar mining. The oldest of the basic underground methods, room-and-pillar mining, grew naturally out of the need to recover more coal as mining operations became deeper and more expensive. Conventional techniques are being replaced by single machines, known as continuous miners, that break off the coal from the seam and transfer it back to the haulage system."
  tech_electric_cap_lights: "Electric Cap Lights"
