  dandt.6.t: "Competition Breeds Better Business"
  dandt.6.d: "Due to our business-friendly policies, the economy is growing and exciting startups are popping up everywhere. Economic analysts are saying growth is increasing, new jobs are opening, and unemployment decreasing, attributing it to the healthy amount of competition within the market. New businesses are competing toe-to-toe with large corporations in exciting David and Goliath standoffs which are being recorded all across the country. This has the effect of lowering prices, letting consumers consume more and producers sell more. It is a prosperous time in our country."
  dandt.6.a: "Capitalism at its finest"
  dandt.7.t: "Private Monopoly Forms"
  dandt.7.d: "Our Laissez Faire policy has lead to a monopoly forming in the private sector. These kinds of monopolies are often known to interfere with government affairs through lobbying and bribes, and due to our very lax economic policies, we can do nothing to stop them. We will simply have to wait until either competition catches up with them or the government gets its head in the game and enacts Anti-Trust laws."
  dandt.7.e: "Our economic policies have lead to a monopoly forming in the private sector. These kinds of monopolies are often known to interfere with government affairs through lobbying and bribes, but due to our Anti-Trust laws, we can move in to stop the monopoly. Doing so will hurt our economy in the short term, and will be politically taxing, but will help the economy in the long run. Will you strike down this monopoly or let it be?"
  dandt.7.f: "Our economic policies have lead to a monopoly forming in the private sector. These kinds of monopolies are often known to interfere with government affairs through lobbying and bribes, but due to our Anti-Trust laws, we can move in to stop the monopoly. Doing so will hurt our economy in the short term, and will be politically taxing, but will help the economy in the long run. Alternatively, we can nationalize this private monopoly and put it under government control. Will you strike down this monopoly, incorporate it into the state, or let it be?"
  dandt.7.a: "Leave it alone"
  dandt.7.b: "Levy the Anti-Trust laws!"
  dandt.7.c: "Incorporate it into the government"
  dandt.8.t: "Private Monopoly Influences our Government"
  dandt.8.d: "In the private sector, a monopoly formed breaking the backs of competition across the country. Today, this monopoly has turned its sights onto our politicians. These corrupt politicians take bribes and lobbying funds in exchange for protecting the company from the harm of targeted regulations and anti-Trust laws, and in regulated economies, they can pass regulations that hurt small and medium businesses more than these huge corporations. In an environment where there are multiple monopolies working together, this can have a disastrous impact on the middle class and working class of the country, keeping wages high enough to make small businesses struggle, and low enough to line the pockets of the few who control these corporations."
  dandt.8.a: "Darn corrupt politicans!"
