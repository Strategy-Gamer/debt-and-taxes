 disaster_boll_weevil_infestation_desc: ""Aboll weevil is an insect," the blues song goes. "And he's found mostly where cotton grows." By 1915, the devastating boll weevil had eaten its way through much of the American South's cotton crop. The "wave of evil" proved to be a costly nuisance for southern farmers. Ineffective government-sponsored measures drove locals to turn to folk remedies in hopes of protecting their lucrative crop. Southern agriculture took a huge hit, and its labor force, mostly African American sharecroppers, found themselves out of work. Tens of thousands headed north in a mass exodus coined the Great Migration. Even though the beetle has largely vanished, its infestation has had long-term consequences for southern agriculture. Farmers began to diversify their crops, adding staples like corn and wheat."
