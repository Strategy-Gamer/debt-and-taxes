Employees
    There are four "types" of employees
        Slaves
        Workers
        Professionals
        Businessmen
    #Workers consist of all pop types outside of slaves, professionals and businessmen who are allowed to work in the business
    Slaves do not attain throughput bonuses from literacy or education
    #Professionals increase the output amounts of the industry. A multiplier is applied to the industry output which is 1 + the % of professionals. This means Professionals are extremely
        #valuable, however they are much more expensive to employ
    Businessmen reduce the maintenance need of the industry by up to a 20% reduction. The recommended amount is 10% businessmen as any more will not provide any additional benefits aside
        from the normal throughput amount

Pay
    Pay is awarded via a system of minimum wages and "bonuses"
    
    Each pop type is first paid wages. This is dictated by supply and demand in the state & the number of pops. 
        If the wages are below the national minimum wage, then the pops are paid at that rate instead
    
    In addition to that, half of the industry's profit (Excess revenue of expenses) is divided into bonuses. These bonuses are then given out like this:
        Slaves: 0 Bonuses (Slaves are just paid wages)
        Workers: 1 Bonus
        Professionals: 4 Bonuses
        Businessmen: 5 Bonuses
    #This does not mean all worker pops of an industry get 10% of the income. It is further weighted by the amount. So if 90% of an industry are workers and the rest businessmen
        #then the workers would get roughly 34.6% of the industry's profit

    The other half of the industry's profit is split evenly between the industry itself and the owners/investors (Which is then split among them according to ownership)

    Example: Steel Mill with 75K Craftsmen, 15K Professionals, 10K Businessmen, owned completely by local businessmen, wage of $1/hour, and the industry has a profit of $40.0 million
    #Craftsmen - $16.8 in Wages - $8.106 in Bonuses
    #Professionals - $3.36 in Wages - $6.486 in Bonuses
    #Businessmen - $2.24 in Wages - $5.405 in Bonuses - $10 Million from ownership
    #Industry - $10 from Profit
    Totals / Per Capita Income
    #Craftsmen - $24.906 - $0.332 per Capita
    #Professionals - $9.846 - $0.656 per Capita
    #Businessmen - $17.645 - $1.765 per Capita
